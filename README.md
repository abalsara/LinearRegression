# LinearRegression
This program performs a Linear Regression on a data set. It can be used 
to model the relationship between 1 independent and 1 dependent variable.
Given a set of randomized data points, this program finds and graphs a
line of best fit. 

- My Linear Regression class handles the main code and mathmetics of this 
program. 
- My Graphing class handles the visual graphing aspect of the program,
using DrawingPanel
- My Point class keeps track of a single Point, composed of x and y coordinates.
- The DrawingPanel classes, written by my previous professor Stuart Reges, forms
a simple java drawing window program
